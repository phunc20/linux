`eog` is installed by default (seems to come alone with `gnome`). And `ranger` will default to open images by `eog`, even if you've installed your preferred program like `sxiv`, etc.

You can remove `eog` by `sudo dnf remove eog` or just configure `ranger` to default to your favorite image viewer program.
