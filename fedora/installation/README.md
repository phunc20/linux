## Swap Space
It seems that, when you choose to manually partition your disk during the installation process, you don't have to assign separately a swap space; instead,
Fedora will always create one for you. That is to say, had you created one, you'll have the sum of two swap spaces, say, for example, you've saved a
`4GB` for swap, then Fedora's automatically created swap space is also `4GB`, you'll get a total of `8GB` swap space.
