To have `dmenu_run` on gnome under Fedora33, compile the code of `dmenu` and then
put the executables (`dmenu, dmenu_run, dmenu_path, stest`) under `$PATH` (Use symlink would be good enough). Then to link the key combination `Alt-p` to `dmenu_run` in gnome, open the `[Keyboard Shortcuts]` to configure it like the figure below.
