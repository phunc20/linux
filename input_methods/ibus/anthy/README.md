## Arch Linux
On Arch Linux, after installing by `pacman -S ibus-anthy`, one needs to reboot the machine before being able
to use Anthy. So, after rebooting, go to `ibus-setup > add > Japanese > Anthy` and add it.

Note that there is a preference button, where you can adjust some key bindings or use the default ones.
It requires some getting used to. For example,

- `Ctrl-j` for changing input btw English and Hiragana
- `Space` for converting Hiragana to Kanji candidates
- `Ctrl->` for changing btw Hiragana/Katakana/half-width Katakana, etc.
