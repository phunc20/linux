There is no command called `unicode`. This directory records notes about how to
type unicode characters by unicode code point

> You can enter any Unicode character using only your keyboard with the numeric code point of the character. Every character is identified by a **_four-character code point_**. To find the code point for a character, look it up in the _Characters_ application. The code point is the four characters after `U+`.
>
> To enter a character by its code point, press `Ctrl + Shift + U`, then type the four-character code and press `Space` or `Enter`. If you often use characters that you canâ€™t easily access with other methods, you might find it useful to memorize the code point for those characters so you can enter them quickly.
