To resize `mpv`, different desktop managers have different ways, e.g.

- dwm: Hold on (Alt + mouse right button) and then shift your cursor to resize.
- gnome:
    1. Click on (Win + mouse right button) to have a menu pop out.
    2. Choose the "Resize" option on the menu.
    3. Rmk. There is also an interesting option named "Always on top", which
       could be beneficial when doing screencast with a face camera.
