To reload that file to its latest state, just type (in <code>vim</code>'s navigation mode) <code><b>:e</b></code> (i.e. <code><b>:edit</b></code>).

## `vim-surround`
Sometimes it might feel cumbersome to have to
01. visually select text
02. put them btw `**`'s to make them **bold**

Here is [a good stackoverflow post on this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32769488/double-vim-surround-with).

Basically it's saying
01. Put this line in your `.vimrc` (or `init.vim` if you use neovim)
  ```
  autocmd FileType markdown,octopress let b:surround_{char2nr('b')} = "**\r**"
  ```
02. After that you can visually select some text and then press `Sb`
03. To make a single word bold, just do `ysiwb`
04. Recall:
  - To surround a selection w/ parentheses, you do the selection and then `S)`
  - To surround a word w/ parentheses, you do `ysiw)`
  - If you want, you can also do with 4 words using `ys4wb` or `ys4w)`
