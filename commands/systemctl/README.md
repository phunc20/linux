```bash
~/.../02-types-operators-expressions/09-bitwise_operators/exo-02-06 ❯❯❯ sudo systemctl disable postgresql
Removed /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/postgresql.service.
```

Note that the path `/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/postgresql.service.` seems to be similar to the path which is needed to turn of desktop manager of Ubuntu.
