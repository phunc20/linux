`type` has almost the same effect as `which`, which is to indicate where each command/executable lies (as a file) in the current machine.

```bash
phunc20@cingular-x61s:~$ type clear
clear is /usr/bin/clear
phunc20@cingular-x61s:~$ which clear
/usr/bin/clear
phunc20@cingular-x61s:~$ type cd
cd is a shell builtin
phunc20@cingular-x61s:~$ which cd
phunc20@cingular-x61s:~$
```
