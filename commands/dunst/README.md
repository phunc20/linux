## `dunst` run as a daemon in `.xinitrc`
```bash
dunst
dunst -font "Liberation Mono 14"
```

## `notify-send` ugly?
After `pacman -S dunst`, an example configuration file is included at `/usr/share/dunst/dunstrc`. Copy this file to `~/.config/dunst/dunstrc` and you'll get a prettier notification "window".
