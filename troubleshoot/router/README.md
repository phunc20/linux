## Change SSID and the password of an access point
To illustrate, we put ourselves in a concret example: We have a principle box/router at the ground floor,
and a second, auxiliary router at 2nd floor. At 2nd floor, one can enter the interface of both routers via
diff urls as follows.
```
192.168.1.1 principal router
192.168.0.1 auxiliary router
```

I've checked and confirmed that via the `192.168.0.1`, i.e. the auxiliary router's interface, one can
modify SSID and password. Usually, on the back of the box will display its login and pass, for example,
a TP-Link box of mine has login and pass as `admin` and `admin`, respectively. (Yes, its login and
pass are exactly the same.)

Once entered into the interface using your web browser, it's intuitive to achieve the necessary modifications.
